## About LPGPU2

Low-Power Parallel Computing on GPUs 2 (LPGPU<sup>2</sup>) is a EU-funded research project into low powered graphics devices. It is the work of a specially formed consortium of four companies and one university, all from across the EU, who are collaborating to deliver advances in tools and applications for energy efficient use of mobile GPUs.

## About this repository
