/// \brief AMD API to control profiling of either sampling or counting events.
/// \note This API is only valid for nodes with AMD processors.
//
// There are two main ways to use the profiling API: sampling and counting.
// Sampling will interrupt and take a sample of the current execution at the
// specified intervals. Counting will return the count of the specified events
// on command.
//
// When using this API, using any of the \ref sampling functions will result in
// a .prd file containing raw profiling data and a .ti file containing task
// information.  Using the \ref counting functions will not result in any files.
//
// Before any profiling is done, the \ref fnEnableProfiling function must be
// called.  When all profiling is finished, the \ref fnReleaseProfiling function
// must be called.
//
// If anything other than SUCCEEDED(HRESULT) was returned, the function \ref
// fnGetLastProfileError may give you some insight as to what the trouble was.
//
// There are three groups of functions: \ref profiling, \ref counting, and
// \ref sampling
//
// \defgroup profiling Profiling
// This part applies to all profiles, whether counting or sampling.  Profiles
// are exclusive, and different types may not be done simultaneously.
//
// \defgroup counting Counting
// A counting profile will let you count the number of specified events that
// occurred.
//
// There are two exclusive ways to use counting mode.  You can create a array
// of counters  to be counted or you can create the events and set them to
// indivdual cores  and counters yourself.
//
// The expected use of this would be to use \ref fnMakeProfileEvent to create
// several performance events and then set the desired events in a array or set
// them individually and start profiling with \ref fnStartProfiling.  During
// the profile, the counters can be read.
//
// \defgroup sampling Sampling
// A sampling profile will take a sample or interrupt whenever the period elapses.
//
// With timer-based sampling, the period is based on a time interval, in
// nanoseconds.  With event-based sampling, the period is based on accumulated
// performance events, on which the frequency depends on the selected event.
// With instruction-based sampling, the period can depend on ops and/or
// fetches.
//
// The expected use of this would be to use \ref fnSetProfileOutputFile to
// set an output file, set up one type of profiling configuration with \ref
// fnSetTimerConfiguration, \ref fnSetEventConfiguration, or \ref
// fnSetIbsConfiguration,   and then start profiling with \ref
// fnStartProfiling.
//
// After the profile has been stopped, you may use the
// \ref CaProfileDataAccessAPI.h to retrieve the data or import the .prd file
// into CodeAnalyst.  After the profile has been stopped, the configuration
// is not persistent, so you must set everything again to repeat the run.
