international copyright treaties, as well as other intellectual property
laws and treaties. The Licensed Software is licensed, not sold.

3. By installing, copying, or otherwise using the Licensed Software,
Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. If Licensee

Agreement, Riverbank grants Licensee the right to use the Licensed
Software in the manner provided below.

GENERAL TERMS THAT APPLY TO APPLICATIONS AND REDISTRIBUTABLES
9. a) Riverbank grants Licensee a nonexclusive, perpetual, royalty-free right
to reproduce and distribute the object code form of certain portions of the
Licensed Software ("Redistributables"), as specified in Appendix 1,
Section 1, for execution on any supported operating system. Copies of
Redistributables may only be distributed with and for the sole purpose of
executing Applications permitted under this Agreement that Licensee has
created using the Licensed Software. Under no circumstances may any copies of
Redistributables be distributed separately. This Agreement does not give
Licensee any rights to distribute any of the parts of the Licensed
Software listed in Appendix 1, Section 2, neither as a whole nor as
parts or snippets of code.

b) Licensee may not distribute, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of
Redistributables, solely or as part of an Application, its source code,
in binary/compiled form, or in any other form, if such action is part of
a joint software and hardware distribution, except as set forth below or
provided by a separate runtime distribution license with Riverbank or
one of its authorized distributors. A joint hardware and software
distribution shall be defined as either: (i) distribution of a hardware
device that includes the Licensed Software; or (ii) distribution of the
Licensed Software onto a device designed to facilitate the installation
of the Licensed Software onto the same device and where the core
functionality of the device will depend on the Licensed Software.

c) If the combination of the Licensed Software and hardware and/or
software ("Product"), in the final working end-user configuration either
(i) relies on Apple OS X (R) or Windows 98/ME/2000/2003/ XP/Vista (R)
(however not including embedded versions of these, e.g XP Embedded) as
an integral part of and foundation for its functionality; or (ii) is a
workstation, server, desktop computer or notebook computer relying on a
complete 3rd party desktop environment such as KDE or GNOME as an
integral part of and foundation for its functionality; or (iii) requires a
permanent mains power supply for normal operation; or (iv) does not lose
core functionality when the Licensed Software is removed, then Licensee
is hereby granted an exception from the requirement for a runtime
distribution license agreement.

d) In all instances not covered above, Licensee shall contact Riverbank
or one of Riverbank's authorized distributors to obtain a distribution
license agreement.

10. The license granted in this Agreement for Licensee to create
Applications and distribute them and the Redistributables (if any) to
Licensee's customers is subject to all of the following conditions: (i)
all copies of the Applications Licensee creates must bear a valid
copyright notice, either Licensee's own or the copyright notice that
appears on the Licensed Software; (ii) Licensee may not remove or alter
any copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notice contained in
any portion of the Licensed Software; (iii) Licensee shall not make any
warranties in respect of the Redistributables on behalf of Riverbank, any
such warranties shall be solely made by Licensee; (iv) Licensee will
indemnify and hold Riverbank, its related companies and its suppliers,
harmless from and against any claims or liabilities arising out of the
use, reproduction or distribution of Applications, except where such
claims or liabilities arise as a result of claims that the Licensed
Software or Redistributables, as delivered by Riverbank, infringe the
intellectual property of a third party; (v) Applications must be
developed using a licensed, registered copy of the Licensed Software;
(vi) Applications must add primary and substantial functionality to the
Licensed Software; (vii) Applications may not pass on functionality
which in any way makes it possible for others to create software with
the Licensed Software; (viii) Applications may not compete with the
Licensed Software; (ix) Licensee may not use Riverbank's or any of its
suppliers' names, logos, or trademarks to market Application(s), except
to state that Application was developed using the Licensed Software.

11. Warranty Disclaimer: The Licensed Software is licensed to Licensee
"as is". To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Riverbank on
behalf of itself and its suppliers, disclaims all warranties and
conditions, either express or implied, including, but not limited to,
implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
title and non-infringement with regard to the Licensed Software.

12. Limitation of Liability: If, Riverbank's warranty disclaimer
notwithstanding, Riverbank is held liable to Licensee, whether in
contract, tort or any other legal theory, based on the Licensed
Software, Riverbank's entire liability to Licensee and Licensee's
exclusive remedy shall be, at Riverbank's option, either (A) return of
the price Licensee paid for the Licensed Software, or (B) repair or
replacement of the Licensed Software, provided Licensee returns to
Riverbank all copies of the Licensed Software as originally delivered to
Licensee. Riverbank shall not under any circumstances be liable to
Licensee based on failure of the Licensed Software if the failure
resulted from accident, abuse or misapplication, nor shall Riverbank
under any circumstances be liable for special damages, punitive or
exemplary damages, damages for loss of profits or interruption of
business or for loss or corruption of data. Any award of damages from
Riverbank to Licensee shall not exceed the total amount Licensee has
paid to Riverbank in connection with this Agreement.

13. Support and Updates: Licensee will be eligible to receive access
to Updates to the Licensed Software ("Updates") for a period not to
exceed one year from the date of initial delivery ("Initial Term"), in
accordance with Riverbank's then current policies and procedures, if any.
Such policies and procedures may be changed from time to time. Following
the Initial Term, Riverbank will no longer make the Licensed Software
available to Licensee unless Licensee purchases additional Updates
according to section 14 below; however, Licensee's license to the previous
versions of the Licensed Software for which Licensee has paid the applicable
fees shall continue.

14. Renewal of Updates: Licensee may purchase additional Updates
following the Initial Term at Riverbank's terms and conditions
applicable at the time of renewal.


GENERAL PROVISIONS
15. Marketing: Riverbank may not include Licensee's company name and logo in
a publicly available list of Riverbank customers unless Riverbank first
obtains Licensee's written permission to do so.

16. Assignment: Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations
hereunder, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior
express written consent of the other party.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,
either party may assign this Agreement without consent of the other party in
connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of
its assets.  Any attempt by a party to assign its rights or obligations
under this Agreement in breach of this Section shall be void and of no
effect.  Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall bind and inure to the
benefit of the parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns.

17. Termination: Riverbank may terminate the Agreement at any time
immediately upon written notice by Riverbank to Licensee if Licensee
breaches this Agreement, fails to pay the fees for the Licensed
Software, or infringes Riverbank's intellectual property in or to the
Licensed Software. Upon termination of the Licenses, Licensee shall
return to Riverbank all copies of Licensed Software that were supplied
by Riverbank. All other copies of Licensed Software in the possession or
control of Licensee must be erased or destroyed. An officer of Licensee
must promptly deliver to Riverbank a written confirmation that this has
occurred.

18. Clauses that survive termination: Sections 2, 6, 7, 8, 12, 19, 20
and 22 shall survive the termination of this Agreement, however Sections
6 and 7 shall not survive if the Agreement is terminated for cause.

19. Entire Agreement: This Agreement constitutes the complete agreement
between the parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
discussions, representations, and proposals, written or oral, with
respect to the subject matters discussed herein. No modification of this
Agreement will be effective unless contained in a writing executed by an
authorized representative of each party. No term or condition contained
in Licensee's purchase order will apply unless expressly accepted by
Riverbank in writing. If any provision of the Agreement is found void or
unenforceable, the remainder will remain valid and enforceable according
to its terms. If any remedy provided is determined to have failed for
its essential purpose, all limitations of liability and exclusions of
damages set forth in this Agreement shall remain in effect.

20. Confidentiality: Each party acknowledges that during the term of
this Agreement it will have access to information about the other
party's business, business methods, business plans, customers, business
relations, technology, and other information, including the terms of
this Agreement, that is confidential and of great value to the other
party, and the value of which would be significantly reduced if
disclosed to third parties (the "Confidential Information").
Accordingly, when a party (the "Receiving Party") receives Confidential
Information from another party (the "Disclosing Party"), the Receiving
Party shall, and shall obligate its employees and agents to: (i)
maintain the Confidential Information in strict confidence; (ii) not
disclose the Confidential Information to a third party without the
Disclosing Party's prior written approval; and (iii) not, directly or
indirectly, use the Confidential Information for any purpose other than
for exercising its rights and fulfilling its responsibilities pursuant
to this Agreement. Each party shall take reasonable measures to protect
the Confidential Information of the other party, which measures shall
not be less than the measures taken by such party to protect its own
confidential and proprietary information. "Confidential Information"
shall not include information that (a) is or becomes generally known to
the public through no act or omission of the Receiving Party; (b) was in
the Receiving Party's lawful possession prior to the disclosure
hereunder and was not subject to limitations on disclosure or use; (c)
is developed by the Receiving Party or by persons who have not had
access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party; (d) is
lawfully disclosed to the Receiving Party without restrictions, by a
third party not under an obligation of confidentiality; or (e) the
Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose the information, in
which case the Receiving Party shall assert the privileged and
confidential nature of the information and cooperate fully with the
Disclosing Party to protect against and prevent disclosure of any
Confidential Information and to limit the scope of disclosure and the
dissemination of disclosed Confidential Information by all legally
available means. The obligations of the Receiving Party under this
Section shall continue during the Term and for a period of twelve (12)
months after expiration or termination thereof; provided, however, that
with respect to trade secret information, the obligations of the
Receiving Party under this Section shall continue as long as such
information remains a trade secret under applicable law.

21. Governing law, legal venue: This Agreement shall be construed,
interpreted and governed by the laws of England.

22. Riverbank reserves all rights not specifically granted in this
Agreement.
